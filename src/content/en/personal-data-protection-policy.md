## Data Processing Principles

1.  Playform’s processing activities must be in line with the principles
    specified in this Section. The Privacy Manager must make sure that
    Playform’s compliance documentation, as well as data processing activities,
    are compliant with the data protection principles.

2.  We must process the Personal Data in accordance with the following
    principles:

    1.  Lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner (**lawfulness, fairness and
        transparency**). We shall always have a legal ground for the processing
        (described in Section 3 of this Policy), collect the amount of data
        adequate to the purpose and legal grounds, and we make sure the Data
        Subjects are aware of the processing;

    2.  Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not
        further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes
        (**purpose limitation**). We must not process the Personal Data for the
        purposes not specified in our compliance documentation without obtaining
        specific approval of the Privacy Manager;

    3.  Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for
        which they are processed (**data minimization**). We always make sure
        the data we collect is not excessive and limited by the strict
        necessity;

    4.  Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date (**accuracy**). We
        endeavor to delete inaccurate or false data about Data Subjects and make
        sure we update the data. Data Subjects can ask us for a correction of
        the Personal Data;

    5.  Kept in a form which permits identification of Data Subjects for no
        longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the Personal Data
        are processed (**storage period limitation**). The storage periods must
        be limited as prescribed by Data Protection Laws and this Policy; and

    6.  Process in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the Personal
        Data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing
        and accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical
        or organizational measures (**confidentiality, integrity, and
        availability**).

3.  **<span class="underline">Accountability.</span>**

    1.  We shall be able to demonstrate our compliance with Data Protection Laws
        (**accountability principle**). In particular, we must ensure and
        document all relevant procedures, efforts, internal and external
        consultations on personal data protection including:

        -   the fact of appointing a person responsible for Playform’s data
            protection compliance;

        -   where necessary, a record of a Data Processing Impact Assessment;

        -   developed and implemented notices, policies, and procedures, such as
            Privacy Notice, this policy or Data Breach response procedure;

        -   the fact of staff training on compliance with Data Protection laws;
            and

        -   assessment, implementation, and testing organizational and technical
            data protection measures.

    2.  The Privacy Manager must maintain Playform’s Records of processing
        activities, which is an accountability document that describes personal
        data processing activities of Playform, prepared in accordance with Art.
        30 of the GDPR (the “**Records of processing activities**”). The Records
        of processing activities must maintain, at least, the following
        information about each processing activity:

        -   contact details of Playform, the EU Representative, and, where
            applicable, of the Data Protection Officer;

        -   name of the activity, its purposes and legal basis along with, where
            applicable, the legitimate interests of Playform;

        -   data subjects and personal data categories concerned;

        -   data retention periods;

        -   general description of applicable security measures;

        -   recipients, including joint controllers, processors, and contractors
            involved, as well as the fact of the international data transfer
            with the safeguards applied to the transfer;

        -   where applicable, a reference to the Data Processing Impact
            Assessment;

        -   where applicable, a reference to the record of the data breach
            occurred involving the personal data;

        -   if Playform acts as a data processor, the information to be provided
            includes the names and contact details of controllers, name and
            contact details of controller's representative (if applicable),
            categories of processing (activities), names of third countries or
            international organizations that personal data are transferred to
            (if applicable), safeguards for exceptional transfers of personal
            data to third countries or international organizations (if
            applicable), and general description of technical and organizational
            security measures.

## Legal Grounds and Purposes

1.  **<span class="underline">Legal grounds.</span>**

    1.  Each processing activity must have one of the lawful grounds specified
        in this Section to process the Personal Data. If we do not have any of
        the described, we cannot collect or further process the Personal Data.

    2.  If Playform is intended to use personal data for other purposes than
        those specified in the Records of processing activities, the Privacy
        Manager must evaluate, determine, and, if necessary, collect/record the
        appropriate legal basis for it.

    3.  **Performance of the contract**. Where Playform has a contract with the
        Data Subject, e.g., website’s Terms of Use or the employment contract,
        and the contract requires the provision of personal data from the Data
        Subject, the applicable legal ground will be the performance of the
        contract.

    4.  **Consent**. To process the personal data based on the consent, we must
        obtain the consent before the Processing and keep the evidence of the
        consent with the records of Data Subject’s Personal Data. The Privacy
        Manager must make sure that the consent collected from Data Subjects
        meet the requirements of Data Protection Laws and this Policy. In
        particular, the Privacy Manager must make sure that:

        -   the Data Subject must be free to give or refuse to give consent.

        -   the consent is in the form of an active indication from the Data
            Subject, i.e., the consent checkbox must not be pre-ticked for the
            user.

        -   the request for the consent clearly articulates the purposes of the
            processing, and other information specified in Subsection 6.2 is
            available to the Data Subject.

        -   the Data Subject must be free to give one’s consent or to revoke it.

    5.  **Legitimate interests**. We have the right to use personal data in our
        ‘legitimate interests’. The interests can include the purposes that are
        justified by the nature of our business activities, such as the
        marketing analysis of personal data. For Playform to use legitimate
        interests as a legal ground for the processing, the Privacy Manager must
        make sure that:

        -   the legitimate interest in the processing is clearly defined and
            recorded in the Records of processing activities;

        -   any envisaged risks to Data Subject rights and interests are
            spotted. The examples of the risks can be found in Subsection 7.2.;

        -   the Data Subjects have reasonable expectations about the processing,
            and additional protective measures to address the risks are taken;

        -   subject to the conditions of Subsection 6.7 (Right to object against
            the processing), the Data Subject is provided with the opportunity
            to opt-out from the processing for the described legitimate
            interests.\
            If at least one of the above conditions is not met by Playform, the Privacy
            Manager must choose and propose a different legal ground for the processing,
            such as consent.

    6.  **Legal Compliance and Public Interest**. Besides the grounds specified
        afore, we might be requested by the laws of the European Union or laws
        of the EU Member State to process Personal Data of our Users. For
        example, we can be required to collect, analyze, and monitor the
        information of Users to comply with financial or labor laws.\
        Whenever we have such an obligation, we must make sure that:

        -   we process personal data strictly in accordance with relevant legal
            requirements;

        -   we do not use or store the collected Personal Data for other
            purposes than legal compliance; and

        -   the Data Subjects are properly and timely informed about our
            obligations, scope, and conditions of personal data processing.

Important: Where Playform has the law requirements of another country to process
personal data, the Privacy Manager must propose using another legal ground for
the processing under Data Protection Laws, such as legitimate interests or
consent.

## Access to Personal Data

1.  **<span class="underline">Access to Personal Data.</span>**

    1.  The employees must have access to the personal data on a “need-to-know”
        basis. The data can be accessed only if it is strictly necessary to
        perform one of the activities specified in the Records of processing
        activities. The employees and contractors shall have access to the
        Personal Data only if they have the necessary credentials for it.

    2.  Heads of the departments within Playform are responsible for their
        employees’ access and processing of personal data. The heads must
        maintain the list of employees that are entitled to access and process
        personal data. The Privacy Manager shall have the right to review the
        list and, where necessary, request the amendments to meet the
        requirements of this Policy.

    3.  Heads of the departments within Playform must ensure that the employees
        under their supervision are aware of the Data Protection Laws and comply
        with the rules set in this Policy. To make sure our employees are able
        to comply with the data protection requirements, we must provide them
        with adequate data protection training.

    4.  All employees accessing personal data shall keep strict confidentiality
        regarding the data they access. The employees that access personal data
        must use only those means (software, premises, etc.) for the processing
        that were prescribed by Playform. The data must not be disclosed or
        otherwise made available out of the management instructions.

    5.  The employees within their competence must assist Playform’s
        representatives, including the Privacy Manager, in any efforts regarding
        compliance with Data Protection Laws and/or this Policy.

    6.  When an employee detects or believes there is suspicious activity, data
        breach, non-compliance with Data Protection Laws and/or this Policy, or
        a DSR was not routed to the competent department within Playform, the
        employee must report such activity to the Privacy Manager.

    7.  Employees that are unsure about whether they can legitimately process or
        disclose Personal Data must seek advice from the Privacy Manager before
        taking any action.

    8.  Any occasional access to personal data for activities not specified in
        the Records of processing activities is prohibited. If there is a strict
        necessity for immediate access, the Privacy Manager must approve the
        access first.

## Third Parties

1.  Before sharing personal data with any person outside of Playform, the
    Privacy Manager must ensure that this Third Party has an adequate data
    protection level and provide sufficient data protection guarantees in
    accordance with Data Protection Laws, including, but not limited to the
    processorship requirements (Art. 28 of the GDPR) and international transfers
    compliance (Section 5 of the GDPR). Where necessary, the Privacy Manager
    must make sure that Playform enters into the appropriate data protection
    contract with the third party.

2.  An employee can share personal data with third parties only if and to the
    extent that was directly prescribed by the manager and specified in the
    Records of processing activities.

3.  If we are required to delete, change, or stop the processing of the Personal
    Data, we must ensure that the Third Parties, with whom we shared the
    Personal Data, will fulfill these obligations accordingly.

4.  Whenever Playform is engaged as a data processor on behalf of another
    entity, the Privacy Manager must make sure Playform complies with the
    processorship obligation. In particular, the appropriate data processing
    agreement in accordance with the Data Protection Laws must be in place. The
    Privacy Manager must supervise the compliance with data processing
    instructions from the controller, including regarding the scope of
    processing activities, involvement of sub-processors, international
    transfers, storage, and further disposal of processed personal data. The
    personal data processed under the processor role must not be processed for
    any other purposes than specified in the relevant instructions, agreement or
    other legal act regulating the relationships with the controller.

## International Transfers

1.  If we have the employees, contractors, corporate affiliates, or Data
    Processors outside of the EEA, and we transfer Personal Data to them for the
    processing, the Privacy Manager must make sure Playform takes all necessary
    and appropriate safeguards in accordance with Data Protection Laws.

2.  The Privacy Manager must assess the safeguards available and propose to the
    Playform’s management the appropriate safeguard for each international
    transfer. The following regimes apply to the transfers of Personal Data
    outside of the EU:

    -   where the European Commission decides that the country has an adequate
        level of personal data protection, the transfer does not require taking
        additional safeguards. The full list of adequate jurisdictions can be
        found on the relevant page of the European Commission’s website[^1].

    -   to transfer Personal Data to our contractors or partners (Data
        Processors or Controllers) in other third countries, we must conclude
        Standard Contractual Clauses with that party. The draft version along
        with the guidance can be found on the relevant page of the European
        Commission’s website[^2];

    -   if we have a corporate affiliate or an entity in other countries, we may
        choose to adopt Binding Corporate Rules in accordance with Article 47 of
        the GDPR or an approved code of conduct pursuant to Article 40 of the
        GDPR;

    -   we also can transfer Personal Data to entities that have an approved
        certification in accordance with Article 42 of the GDPR, which certifies
        an appropriate level of company’s data protection.

[^2]:
    https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en;

3.  As a part of the information obligations, Playform must inform the Data
    Subjects that their Personal Data is being transferred to other countries,
    as well as provide them with the information about the safeguards used for
    the transfer. The information obligation is to be performed in accordance
    with Subsection 6.2.

4.  In the exceptional cases (the “**Derogation**”), where we cannot apply the
    safeguards mentioned afore and we need to transfer Personal Data, we must
    take an explicit consent (active statement) from the Data Subject or it must
    be strictly necessary for the performance of the contract between us and the
    Data Subject, or other derogation conditions apply in accordance with the
    Data Protection Laws. The Privacy Manager must pre-approve any Derogation
    transfers and document the approved Derogations, as well as the rationale
    for them.

## Rights of Data Subjects

1.  **<span class="underline">Our Responsibilities.</span>**

    1.  Privacy Manager is ultimately responsible for handing all DSR received
        by Playform. In the case of receiving any outstanding or unusual DSR,
        the employee must seek advice from the Privacy Manager before taking any
        action.

    2.  DSR Team within Playform is responsible for handling DSRs from Playform
        Users on a daily basis. The Human Resources department is responsible
        for handling the DSR from Playform employees.

    3.  All DSRs from the Users must be addressed at and answered from the
        following e-mail address: dsr@playform.cloud. DSR from the employees can
        be addressed directly to the HR manager or at dsr@playform.cloud.

    4.  The responsible employee must answer to the DSR within one (1) month
        from receiving the request. If complying with the DSR takes more than
        one month in time, the responsible employee must seek advice from the
        Privacy Manager and, where necessary, inform the Data Subject about the
        prolongation of the response term for up to two (2) additional months.

    5.  The responsible employee must analyze the received DSR for the following
        criteria:

        -   **Data Subject identification**. Before considering the DSR content,
            the responsible employee must make sure the Data Subject is the same
            person he/she claims to be. For this purpose, the connection between
            the personal data records and the data subject must be established.

        -   **Personal data**. The responsible employee must check whether
            Playform has access to the personal data requested. If Playform does
            not have the personal data under the control, the responsible
            employee must inform the Data Subject, and, if possible, instruct on
            the further steps on how to access the data in question;

        -   **Content of the request**. Depending on the content of the DSR, the
            responsible employee must define the type of the request and check
            whether it meets the conditions prescribed by this Policy and Data
            Protection Laws. The types of requests and the respective conditions
            for each of them can be consulted in Subsections 6.3-6.9. If the
            request does not meet the described criteria, the responsible
            employee must refuse to comply with the DSR and inform the Data
            Subject about the reasons for refusing;

        -   **Free of charge**. Generally, all requests of Data Subjects and
            exercises of their rights are free of charge. If the responsible
            employee finds that the Data Subject exercises the rights in an
            excessive or unfound way (e.g., intended to harm or interrupt
            Playform’s business activities), the employee must seek the advice
            from the Privacy Manager, and, upon receiving of the latter, may
            either charge the Data Subject a reasonable fee or refuse to comply
            with the request;

        -   **Documenting**. Whenever Playform receives the DSR, the Privacy
            Manager must make sure that the data and time, Data Subject, type of
            the request and the decision made regarding it are well documented.
            In the case of refusing to comply with the request, the reasons for
            refusing must be documented as well;

        -   **Recipients**. When addressing the DSR, the Privacy Manager must
            make sure that all concerned recipients were informed the necessary
            actions were taken.

2.  **<span class="underline">The right to be informed.</span>**

    1.  Playform must notify each Data Subject about the collection and further
        processing of the Personal Data.

    2.  The information to be provided includes: the name and contact details of
        Playform; generic purposes of and the lawful basis for the data
        collection and further processing; categories of Personal Data
        collected; recipients/categories of recipients; retention periods;
        information about data subject rights, including the right to complain
        to the competent Supervisory Authority; the consequences of the cases
        where the data is necessary for the contract performance and the Data
        Subject does not provide the required data; details of the safeguards
        where personal data is transferred outside the EEA; and any third-party
        source of the personal data, without specification for the particular
        case (except if we receive the direct request from the Data Subject).

    3.  The Users must be informed by the Privacy Policy accessible at
        Playform’s website and provided during the user registration. The
        employees and contractors must be informed by a standalone employee
        privacy statement, which explains the details described in p. 6.2.2 in a
        case-based manner, describing the particular purposes and activities.

    4.  Playform must inform Data Subjects about data processing, including any
        new processing activity introduced at Playform within the following
        term:

        -   if personal data is collected from the data subject directly, the
            data subject must be informed at the time we collect Personal Data
            from the Data Subjects by showing the Data Subject our privacy
            statement;

        -   if the personal data is collected from other sources: (a) within one
            month from collecting it; (b) if the personal data are to be used
            for communication with the data subject, at the latest at the time
            of the first communication to that data subject; or (c) if a
            disclosure to another recipient is envisaged, at the latest when the
            personal data are first disclosed.

        -   upon the request of the Data Subject; and

        -   within one (1) month after any change of our personal data
            practices, change of the controller of Personal Data or after
            significant changes in our privacy statements.

3.  **<span class="underline">The right to access the information.</span>**

    1.  The Data Subject must be provided only with those personal data records
        specified in the request. If the Data Subject requests access to all
        personal data concerning her or him, the employee must seek advice from
        the Privacy Manager first, to make sure all personal data of the Data
        Subject is mapped and provided.

    2.  A Data Subject has the right to:

        -   learn if we process the Data Subject’s Personal Data;

        -   obtain disclosure regarding aspects of the processing, including
            detailed and case-specific information on purposes, categories of
            Personal Data, recipients/categories of recipients, retention
            periods, information about one’s rights, details of the relevant
            safeguards where personal data is transferred outside the EEA, and
            any third-party source of the personal data; and

        -   obtain a copy of the Personal Data undergoing processing upon the
            request.

4.  **<span class="underline">The right to verify the Data Subject’s information
    and seek its rectification.</span>** The information we collect can
    be/become inaccurate or out-of-date (e.g., mistakes in nationality, date of
    birth, info on debts, economic activities). If we reveal that the Personal
    Data is inaccurate or the Data Subject requests us to do so, we must ensure
    that we correct all mistakes and update the relevant information.

5.  **<span class="underline">The right to restrict processing.</span>**

    1.  The restriction of processing allows Data Subjects to temporarily stop
        the use of their information to prevent the possible harm caused by such
        use.

    2.  This right applies when the Data Subject:

        -   contests the accuracy of the Personal Data;

        -   believes that we process the Personal Data unlawfully; and

        -   objects against the processing and wants us not to process Personal
            Data while we are considering the request.

    3.  In the case of receiving the restriction request, we must not process
        Personal Data in question for any other purpose than storing it or for
        legal compliance purposes until the circumstances of restriction cease
        to exist.

6.  **<span class="underline">The right to withdraw the consent.</span>** For
    the activities that require consent, the Data Subject can revoke their
    consent at any time. If the Data Subject revokes the consent, we must record
    the changes and must not process the Personal Data for consent-based
    purposes. The withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of the
    processing done before the withdrawal.

7.  **<span class="underline">The right to object against the
    processing.</span>**

    1.  If we process the information in our legitimate interests, e.g., for
        direct marketing emails or for our marketing research purposes, the Data
        Subject can object against the processing.

    2.  In the case of receiving the objection request case, we must consider
        Data Subject’s request and, where we do not have compelling interests,
        stop the processing for the specified purposes. If the personal data is
        still to be processed for other purposes, the Privacy Manager must make
        sure that the database has a record that the data cannot be further
        processed for the objected activities.

    3.  The objection request can be refused only if the personal data in
        question is used for scientific/historical research or statistical
        purposes and was appropriately protected, i.e., by anonymization or
        pseudonymization techniques.

8.  **<span class="underline">Right to erasure/to be forgotten.</span>**

    1.  The Data Subjects have the right to request us to erase their Personal
        Data if one of the following conditions are met:

        -   Personal Data is no longer necessary for the purposes of collection.
            For example, a user has provided personal data for a one-time
            activity, such as data validation or participation in a contest, and
            the purpose is already fulfilled;

        -   the Data Subject revokes one’s consent or objects to the processing
            (where applicable) and there is no other legal ground for the
            processing; or

        -   we process the Personal Data unlawfully or its erasure is required
            by the applicable legislation of the European Union or one of the
            Member countries of the European Union.

    2.  Conditions, under which we have the right to refuse the erasure:

        -   Personal Data is processed for scientific/historical research or
            statistical purposes and is appropriately protected, i.e.,
            pseudonymized or anonymized;

        -   Personal Data is still necessary for legal compliance (e.g.,
            financial or labor laws compliance).

    3.  Only those personal data records must be deleted that were specified in
        the request. If the Data Subject requests the deletion of all personal
        data concerning her or him, the employee must seek advice from the
        Privacy Manager first, to make sure all the data about the Data Subject
        is mapped and can be deleted.

    4.  If the User still has an account with us and requests the erasure of
        information necessary for maintaining the account, we must inform the
        User that the erasure will affect user experience or can lead to the
        closure of the account.

9.  **<span class="underline">Data portability.</span>**

    1.  Data Subjects can ask us to transfer all the Personal Data and/or its
        part in a machine-readable format to a third party. This right applies
        in two cases:

        -   personal data was collected for the purpose of provision of our
            services (performance of the contract); or

        -   collected based on consent.

    2.  To determine whether one of the p.6.9.1 conditions are met, the employee
        must seek advice from the Privacy Manager and check the applicable legal
        basis in the Records of processing activities. If the answer is
        negative, the request can be refused by Playform, and the Privacy
        Manager must decide whether to comply with the request on a voluntary
        basis.

    3.  To comply with the request, the responsible employee must consolidate
        requested Personal Data and send the data in the format we are usually
        working with to the requested organization. The Data Subject must
        provide the necessary contact details of the organization.

## New Data Processing Activities

1.  **<span class="underline">Notification to Privacy Manager.</span>**

    1.  Before introducing any new activity that involves the processing of
        personal data, an employee responsible for its implementation must
        inform the Privacy Manager.

    2.  Upon receiving information about a new activity, Privacy Manager must:

        -   determine whether the data processing impact assessment (DPIA)
            and/or the consultation with the Supervisory Authority is necessary.
            If the answer is positive, the Privacy Manager must make sure the
            DPIA is conducted and/or the Supervisory Authority is consulted in
            accordance with the requirements of this Section and Data Protection
            Laws;

        -   determine the legal basis for the processing and, where necessary,
            take further action for its fixation;

        -   make sure the processing activity is done in accordance with this
            Policy, other Playform’s policies, as well as the Data Protection
            Laws;

        -   add the processing activity to the Records of processing activities;

        -   amend the privacy information statements and, where necessary,
            inform the concerned Data Subject accordingly.

2.  **<span class="underline">Data Processing Impact Assessment.</span>**

    1.  To make sure that our current or prospective processing activities do
        not/will not violate the Data Subjects’ rights, Playform must, where
        required by Data Protection Laws, conduct the Data Processing Impact
        Assessment (DPIA), a risk-based assessment of the processing and search
        for the measures to mitigate the risks. The Privacy Manager must make
        sure the DPIA is conducted in accordance with this Section.

    2.  The Privacy Manager, where necessary, involving the competent employees
        and/or external advisors, must conduct a DPIA if at least one of the
        following conditions are met:

        -   the processing involves the use of new technologies, such as the
            Artificial Intelligence, use of connected and autonomous devices,
            etc. that creates certain legal, economic or similar effects to the
            Data Subject;

        -   we systematically assess and evaluate personal aspects of the Data
            Subjects based on automated profiling, assigning the personal
            score/rate, and create legal or similar effects for the Data Subject
            by this activity;

        -   we process on a large-scale sensitive data, which includes Personal
            Data relating to criminal convictions and offences, the data about
            vulnerable data subjects, the personal data revealing racial or
            ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
            beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic
            data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a
            natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural
            person’s sex life or sexual orientation;

        -   we collect or process Personal Data from a publicly accessible area
            or public sources on a large scale, or combine or match two
            different data sets; and

        -   the Supervisory Authority in its public list requires conducting a
            DPIA for a certain type of activity we are involved in. The list of
            processing activities requiring conducting DPIA can be found on the
            website of each Supervisory Authority.

    3.  The assessment shall contain at least the following details:

        -   a systematic description of the processing operations and the
            purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the
            legitimate interest pursued by us. The description must include the
            envisaged data categories and data subjects concerned, the scale of
            processing activities, such as its frequency, volume, envisaged
            number of records, etc.; recipients of the data, retention periods
            and, where applicable, international transfers;

        -   an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing
            operations in relation to the purposes. The DPIA must explain
            whether the activity is necessary for the purpose and whether the
            purpose can be achieved by less intrusive methods;

        -   an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data
            subjects, including the rights of Data Subjects regarding their
            Personal Data.

        -   The examples of risks are the processing which could lead to
            physical, material or non-material damage, in particular: where the
            processing may give rise to discrimination, identity theft or fraud,
            financial loss, damage to the reputation, loss of confidentiality of
            personal data protected by professional secrecy, unauthorized
            reversal of pseudonymization, or any other significant economic or
            social disadvantage; where data subjects might be deprived of their
            rights and freedoms or prevented from exercising control over their
            personal data; where personal data are processed which reveal racial
            or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or philosophical
            beliefs, trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data,
            data concerning health or data concerning sex life or criminal
            convictions and offences or related security measures; where
            personal aspects are evaluated, in particular analyzing or
            predicting aspects concerning performance at work, economic
            situation, health, personal preferences or interests, reliability or
            behavior, location or movements, in order to create or use personal
            profiles; where personal data of vulnerable natural persons, in
            particular of children, are processed; or where processing involves
            a large amount of personal data and affects a large number of data
            subjects; and

        -   the measures to address the risks, including safeguards, security
            measures, and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data
            and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation.

    4.  Where the DPIA did not provide how to effectively address the risks, the
        Privacy Manager must initiate the consultation with the competent
        Supervisory Authority to receive help with searching for the solution.
        In this case, Playform must not conduct the activity before the
        Supervisory Authority approves the processing activity in question.

## Data Retention

1.  **<span class="underline">General Rule.</span>**

    1.  The Privacy Manager must make sure that Playform clearly defined the
        data storage periods and/or criteria for determining the storage periods
        for each processing activity it has. The periods for each processing
        activity must be specified in the Records of processing activities.

    2.  Each department within Playform must comply with the data storage
        periods in accordance with the retention schedule provided in Records of
        processing activities. The Privacy Manager must supervise each
        department and make sure they comply with this requirement.

    3.  After the storage period ends, the personal data must be removed from
        the disposal of the department responsible for the processing or, in
        cases where the data is not needed for any other purposes, destroyed
        completely, including from back-up copies and other media.

    4.  Whenever the storage period for a processing activity has ended, but the
        personal data processed is necessary for other processing purposes, the
        department manager must make sure that the personal data is not used for
        the ceased processing activity, and the responsible employees do not
        have the access to it unless required for any other activity.

2.  **<span class="underline">Exemptions.</span>** The rules specified in
    Subsection 8.1 have the following exceptions:

    1.  **Business needs**. Data retention periods can be prolonged, but no
        longer than 60 days, in the case that the data deletion will interrupt
        or harm our ongoing business. The Privacy Manager must approve any
        unforeseen prolongation;

    2.  **Technical impossibility**. Some information is technically impossible
        or disproportionally difficult to delete. For example, deletion of the
        information may lead to breach of system integrity, or it is impossible
        to delete the information from the backup copies. In such a case, the
        information can be further stored, subject to the approval by the
        Privacy Manager and making respective amendments to the Records of
        processing activities; and

    3.  **Anonymization**. The Personal Data can be further processed for any
        purposes (e.g., marketing) if we fully anonymize these data after the
        retention period is expired. This means that all personal identifiers
        and connections to them will be deleted from the data. To consider
        Personal Data anonymous, it must be impossible to reidentify the Data
        Subject from the data set.

## Security

1.  Each department within Playform shall take all appropriate technical and
    organizational measures that protect against unauthorized, unlawful, and/or
    accidental access, destruction, modification, blocking, copying,
    distribution, as well as from other illegal actions of unauthorized persons
    regarding the personal data under their responsibility.

2.  The employee responsible for the supervision after the security of personal
    data within Playform shall be DSR Officer. This person implements the
    guidelines and other specifications on data protection and information
    security in his area of responsibility. He/she advises Playform management
    on the planning and implementation of information security in Playform, and
    must be involved in all projects at an early stage in order to take
    security-related aspects into account as early as the planning phase.

## Data Breach Response Procedure

1.  **<span class="underline">Response Team.</span>**

    1.  In case of revealing the Data Breach, CEO of Playform shall urgently
        form the Data Breach Response Team (the “**Response Team**”), which will
        handle the Data Breach, notify the appropriate persons, and mitigate its
        risks.

    2.  The Response Team must be а multi-disciplinary group headed by CEO of
        Playform and comprised of the Privacy Manager, privacy laws specialist
        (whether internal or external), and knowledgeable and skilled
        information security specialists within Playform or outsourcing
        professionals, if necessary. The team must ensure that all employees and
        engaged contractors/processors adhere to this Policy and provide an
        immediate, effective, and skillful response to any suspected/alleged or
        actual Data Breach affecting Playform.

    3.  The potential members of the Response Team must be prepared to respond
        to а Data Breach. The Response Team shall perform all the
        responsibilities of Playform mentioned in this Policy. The duties of the
        Response Team are:

        -   to communicate the Data Breach to the competent Supervisory
            Authority(-ies);

        -   in case of high risk to the rights and freedoms of Data Subjects, to
            communicate the Data Breach to the Data Subject;

        -   if Playform obtain data from any third party as a processor, and a
            Data Breach involves obtained data, to inform the third parties
            about the Data Breach;

        -   to communicate Playform’s contractors or any other third parties
            that process the Personal Data involved in the Data Breach; and

        -   to take all appropriate technical and organizational measures to
            cease the Data Breach and mitigate its consequences;

        -   to record the fact of the Data Breach in the Records of processing
            activities and file an internal data breach report that describes
            the event.

    4.  The Response Team shall perform its duties until all the necessary
        measures required by this Policy are taken.

2.  **<span class="underline">Notification to Supervisory Authority.</span>**

    1.  Playform shall inform the Competent Supervisory Authority about the Data
        Breach without undue delay and, where it is possible, not later than 72
        hours after having become aware of the Data Breach.

    2.  The Competent Supervisory Authority shall be determined by the residence
        of the Data Subjects, whose information was involved in the Data Breach.
        If the Data Breach concerns the Personal Data of Data Subjects from more
        than one country, Playform shall inform all Competent Supervisory
        Authorities.

    3.  To address the notification to the authority, the Response Team should
        use Annex 1 to this Policy. Annex 1 contains all the necessary contact
        information of the EU supervisory authorities. If the Data Breach
        concerns Data Subjects from other than the EU countries, the Response
        Team shall ask a competent privacy specialist for advice.

    4.  The notification to the Competent Supervisory Authority shall contain,
        at least, following information:

        -   **the nature of the Data Breach** including where possible, the
            categories and an approximate number of Data Subjects and Personal
            Data records concerned;

        -   the name and contact details of the **Response Team, Privacy Manager
            or, if not applicable, of the CEO**;

        -   the likely consequences of the Data Breach. Explain Playform’s point
            of view on the purposes and possible further risks of the Data
            Breach. E.g., the Personal Data may be stolen for the further
            **sale, fraud activities or blackmailing the concerned Data
            Subjects**; and

        -   **the measures taken or proposed** to be taken by Playform to
            address the Data Breach, including, where appropriate, measures to
            mitigate its possible adverse effects.

    5.  To file a notification, the Response Team should use Playform’s Data
        Breach Notification Form to the Supervisory Authority.

3.  **<span class="underline">Notifications to Data Subjects.</span>**

    1.  When the Data Breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights
        and freedoms of Data Subjects (e.g., stealing of funds, assets,
        proprietary information), we must also communicate the Data Breach to
        the concerned Data Subjects without undue delay. The Privacy Manager
        must determine if there is a high risk based on the risk factors
        specified in Subsection 7.2.3 of this Policy.

    2.  The notification shall contain the following information:

        -   description of the Data Breach - what happened and what led to the
            Data Breach, such as **a security breach, employee’s negligence,
            error in the system work**. If the Response Team decided not to
            disclose the causes of the Data Breach, then this clause must not be
            mentioned;

        -   the measures taken by Playform regarding the Data Breach, including
            **security measures, internal investigations, and supervisory
            authority notice**;

        -   recommendations for the concerned Data Subjects how to mitigate
            risks and possible consequences, such as **guidelines on how to
            restore access to an account, preventing measures (change of a
            password)**; and

        -   the contact information of the Response Team or one of its members.

    3.  The notification to the Data Subjects should be carried out by the
        **email letter** or, where it is impossible to use the email, by other
        available means of communication.

    4.  **Exemptions**. We do not have to send the notification to the Data
        Subjects if any of the following conditions are met:

        -   Playform has implemented appropriate technical and organizational
            protection measures, and those measures were applied to the Personal
            Data affected by the Data Breach, in particular, those that leave
            the Personal Data inaccessible to any person who is not authorized
            to access it, such as encryption;

        -   Playform has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high
            risk to the rights and freedoms of Data Subjects referred to in this
            section is no longer likely to materialize; or

        -   it would involve a disproportionate effort to communicate with every
            concerned Data Subject. In such a case, there shall instead be a
            public communication or similar measure whereby the Data Subjects
            are informed in an equally effective manner.

In the case we apply one of the exemptions, we **must document** the
circumstances, reason for not informing, and actions taken to meet one of the
exemptions.

4.  **<span class="underline">Communication with Third Parties.</span>**

    1.  In the case a Data Breach concerns the Personal Data shared with us or
        processed by us on behalf of a Third Party, we must also notify the
        Third Party about it within 24 hours. If we process the Personal Data as
        a Data Processor, the notification of the Third Party does not exempt us
        from the duty to mitigate the Data Breach consequences, but we must not
        inform the Competent Supervisory Authority and Data Subjects.

    2.  In case of receiving the notification about the Data Breach from the
        Data Processor or other Third Parties that have access to the Personal
        Data, CEO of Playform shall, in accordance with this Section:

        -   form the Response Team;

        -   request the Third Party to send the information mentioned in
            Subsections 10.2-3 of this Policy;

        -   where necessary, inform the Competent Supervisory Authority(-ies)
            and Data Subjects; and

        -   perform other steps of the Data Breach response procedure.
